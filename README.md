# Mémoire M2-TAL

This repository contains some scripts used to extract the significant patterns analyzed in the mémoire. In addition, the complete results have been added. In the "treebanks" directory, there is a corpus to test the scripts.

The scripts are not all similar but show the different ways in which we tried to extract the patterns. In order to execute them, the repository structure must be maintained.
